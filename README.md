# Final Project

This repository contains three `.Rmd` documents for my final project.

- `nypd-analysis.rmd` contains my write-up of the NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report
- `nypd-analysis-presentation.rmd` contains the slides I used in the video presentation, which were adapted from `nypd-analysis.rmd`
- `covid-data-report` contains my write-up of the Johns Hopkins COVID Data Report

All documents also have the corresponding knit `.html` files for your convenience if you cannot knit them on your own for some reason.
