## "Crime is up since the pandemic"

<div class="notes">
- If you look at enough media coverage of crime in NYC since the pandemic, you start to get kinda confused about
what the outlook really is
- Conservative outlets tend to highlight the increase in crime since the pandemic

## "Crime is down in NYC"

<div class="notes">
- Liberal outlets have recently said that crime is down
- There are differing incentives
    - NY and NYC politics are dominated by Democrats/liberals, they want to make their policy-making look good
    - Republicans/conservatives want to make the situation look bad to attack Democratic policy-making

## In conclusion...

> - Shooting rates did spike during the pandemic in NYC and returned to pre-pandemic levels on aggregate
> - Shooting rate changes during the pandemic varied wildly within NYC, even from block to block
> - Difficult to say if or how violent crime rates influenced voter preferences in 2020
